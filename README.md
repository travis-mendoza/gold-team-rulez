## How to contribute

### Who can contribute
At this time, only team members of gold-team-rulez can contribute to this repository.

### GitHub Flow
For the hackathon, we will follow the **GitHub Flow** branching strategy. This means:
* We have a main branch which cannot be edited directly
* All features and bug fixes get their own branches
* All branches are merged into main via pull requests
* Once a branch has been merged to main, it is deleted

For more detail, see the [GitHub Flow documentation page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow).

Additionally, I (Travis) plan to use issues to track my work - but I do not anticipate this will interfere with the GitHub Flow nor do I think anyone else needs to use issues. For more information about issues, see the [GitHub issues documentation page](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues).
