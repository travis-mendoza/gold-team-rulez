# About the team

Gold Team Rulez is an international team of gold-medal engineers united by friendship... and previous working experience.

Find us in the USA, Argentina, and Spain. During our day job, we build laser communication terminals for satellites.

Our strengths are in mechatronic hardware development and testing, data analysis, fire fighting, life guarding, globe trotting, bilingualism, carpentry, eating ice cream, over-caffeinating, time travel, and eternal life.

Our interests include friendly competition, climbing, surfing, live theater and improv, classic cartoons, memes, and the never-ending search for knowledge.
